## 🧠 Overview  

**Palworld** is a unique **open-world survival game** that mixes creature collection with crafting, base building, and real-time combat. Set in a vibrant yet dangerous world, players must explore, gather resources, and survive while interacting with mysterious creatures known as Pals.

Pals are more than companions — they can assist with construction, production, farming, transportation, and battles. This creates a dynamic gameplay loop where strategic use of creatures directly affects survival and progression. The game allows players to choose peaceful development or aggressive expansion depending on their preferred style.

With its sandbox structure, Palworld encourages experimentation, cooperation, and exploration, offering both solo and multiplayer experiences in a living, reactive world.
